999,"BritishAirways how long is it before you contact someone whos taken my bag by mistake. Ive got a lost luggage ref number.

If we delivered your bag to the carousel and someone else picked it up were not responsible for contacting them on your behalf. However, if theres been a bag left behind well do all we can to get in touch with that customer for them to retrieve it. Julie <BR> BritishAirways When I spoke to BA on the phone earlier they said there had been a bag left behind that is similar. They said you cant return theirs until mine has been returned. Its a bit annoying that you cant contact them and enquire if they have mine by mistake. What are my options? <BR> Hi Dan, I can appreciate your frustration. Unfortunately, were unable to do anything until your bag has been returned, as you already know. You could contact the police and report your bag as stolen, or file a lost bag claim with your travel insurance company.

Kev <BR> BritishAirways Thanks Kev how long do I need to leave it before putting a claim in with you or the insurance? <BR> Hi Dan. If another passenger has your bag, you wouldnt be able to make a claim with us. You may be able to claim through your insurance so you may want to contact them. Kev <BR> BritishAirways So is there absolutely no possibility that you can contact the person whos bag was left and ask. Obviously I would but you wouldnt be able to give me their details. Ive got presents etc in the bag and no money to replace them now, so its essentially ruined my Christmas. <BR> We wouldnt be able to give you their details for data protection reasons, Dan. We cant guarantee we can do anything, as your bag arrived on the carousel. However, please DM us your baggage ref, email and postal address. Leanne <BR> BritishAirways Hi Leanne Ive sent the message thanks Dan <BR>","Someone else has taken their bag after a flight and left their own similar case and wants to know when BA will contact the customer, also asks when they can make an insurance claim. Says that BA will not take any steps to contact the person to return the mistaken bag and that the customer could contact the police and report their bag stolen."

1073,"SWHelp the 2120 Salisbury train from Waterloo. Not really getting much info guys. <BR> SWHelp So it was incorrectly coupled? Really? Your driver decoupled and recoupled it and the doors magically worked. Serious breach in protocol there guys. Playing with safety because previous driver wanted to clock out. <BR> On occasion the electrical contacts that the trains use to pass communications for door controls, power and brake, information systems, etc will not make contact properly. In these cases, detaching and reattaching is the approved process taken in line with our fleet 13 <BR> teams faultfinding instructions, and done under the instruction of maintenance staff and the fleet control manager. The trains failsafe systems would not allow it to move in this situation, and if we could not resolve the problem, the train would be taken out of service. 23 <BR> Safety is, and always will be, our first priority, and in this case protocols were followed correctly. Our fleet team will investigate using onboard monitoring systems as to what when wrong in this case and take appropriate action. DB 33 <BR> SWHelp So wait a second. Once a driver couples the train its not protocol to test immediately, but to wait until the carriages are full of passengers to then couple? Thats your statement? <BR> On more modern stock the train will undertake the necessary tests to confirm. With older trains, there is a pullaway test to confirm the trains are physically coupled together, but it is not always immediately apparent that the all of the 100 contacts on the train 13 <BR> type in question are making suitable contact. Any one of these pins not making proper contact can result in the train not being able to move as part of failsafe systems built in. As mentioned, more modern trains such as our 450 and 444 types have computer systems on board 23 <BR> which test each signal passing through the contacts to confirm that the train is attached both physically and electronically. DB 33 <BR> SWHelp Whilst Im still shocked, I appreciate the fullness of the answer! <BR> No worries Im ex traincrew, so this is rather my specialist topic! Appreciate that it seems a little antiquated, but its all vetted and okayed by the safety bodies. Its similar to the modern trains, where resolving problems can often come down to turning off the 12 <BR> trains management systems and turning them back on again! DB 22 <BR> SWHelp Ahh that makes sense, thought the response was a little more detailed than usual. As a regular passenger I like understanding more, helps me to work around problems and know when to make alternative plans. Its amazing how often turning it off and on again actually works <BR> I always try to give something a bit more detailed, running a railway often has a lot more to it than it appears I was recently conversing with about emissions standards, which was an interesting research topic. Benefits of 6 years experience though! DB <BR> SWHelp Keep up the good work! <BR>","Customer is asking that salisbury train from waterloo.

Even if the airport is quiet, check in times still need to be met. Natalie <BR> BritishAirways Natalie I was 5min late. Plane wasnt expected to leave for 55min, airport was empty, pretty sure security would be too, would guess the plane was tooIm confident I could have made it to the gate with ample time, with just a tiny bit of your help. <BR> Hi Thamin, Im afraid this isnt something we can offer any flexibility with. Its not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesnt allow it. Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when its 12 <BR> busy. I can understand your disappointment, but its your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes. Beth S. 22 <BR> BritishAirways Just for clarification so you never allow anyone and have allowed in the past people that are late for checkin? Could you kindly direct me to this policy too please. <BR> BritishAirways And are you sure Beth that the system does not allow you to do late checkins? <BR> Were sorry, Thamim.

You also make different exceptions for different people it seems <BR> EU compensation depends on the reason for a delay or cancellation, Thamim. Not all flights are eligible as not all reasons are under our control. Were sorry you remain disappointed, however, as previously advised its your responsibility to make sure you arrive at the 12 <BR> airport and check in, in time for your flight. Were unable to hold a flight for a passenger if they are late. Our position remains unchanged.

Whats does that mean and how do I upgrade seats. Thats the whole reason I tweeted you. Cmon Delta aka HML <BR> Freddie, in order upgrade your ticket to First Class, you must pay the difference in the fare. In reviewing your ticket, you have no value left to apply towards the cost of the ticket to upgrade. HML <BR> If youre using miles to upgrade, the cost is 35,000 miles each way and you must be booked in a L, U, or T class fare. HML <BR> Delta What do mean I must pay the difference but then say I have no value left in my ticket? Why not just tell me how much it is to upgrade like Ive been asking from the beginning? What does it mean I have no value in a tix I purchased? <BR> To make changes to your reservation there is a change fee of 200.00. Your ticket is less than the change fee therefore, there is no value in your ticket. I can provide an estimated cost to change your ticket however, this does not include taxes and fees. HML <BR> The estimated cost is 1,500.00 for First Class on your flight from EWR to GCM. This does not include taxes and airport fees and fares are not guaranteed until purchased.
